This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1780

This script enables syntaxic coloration of source code written in the Scala programming language (http://www.scala-lang.org)

Disclaimer

- This is an absolutly basic version
- Only keywords and simple constructs like comments are recognized
- It is by far not finished

Known bugs

- automatic indentation does not work properly when using the syntaxic possibilities of scala (for example when omitting the ; after the return value)
- sign before a number is not colored
